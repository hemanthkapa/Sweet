### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ilovesugar
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**

   ```bash
   cd mcp
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the `mcp/` directory:

   ```env
   DEXCOM_USERNAME=your_dexcom_userame
   DEXCOM_PASSWORD=your_dexcom_password
   DEXCOM_REGION=your_region  # Options: us, ous, jp (us=United States, ous=Outside US, jp=Japan)

   ```

5. **Expose server via Ngrok**
   In a new terminal:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
   Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://randommonkey.ngrok-free.app`)

### Connecting to Poke

1. **Configure Poke MCP Integration**

   In your [Poke](https://poke.com) dashboard, add the Sweet MCP server:

   - Go to your Poke MCP integration settings
   - Add your ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/mcp`) as the server endpoint
   - This allows Poke to communicate with your running Sweet server

2. **Start using Sweet!**

   Simply text Poke on your phone with messages like:

   - "What is my current glucose level?"
   - "I'm having this meal, could you please analyze the macros based on the description/image?"
   - "How much insulin should i be taking for this meal?"
   - "Analyze my glucose levels starting this morning, what meal has affected me the most?"

   Sweet can do much more, your imagination is the limit.
